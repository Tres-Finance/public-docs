## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. **GraphQL Queries**: Data fetched via Apollo Client from BFF service
2. **API Layer**: `overview.api.ts` handles data transformation and caching
3. **Component Layer**: Vue components consume data and handle user interactions
4. **State Management**: Pinia stores manage application state

### Key Dependencies
- Vue 3 with Composition API
- Apollo Client for GraphQL
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Data caching and memoization
- Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Optimized re-rendering with Vue's reactivity system
